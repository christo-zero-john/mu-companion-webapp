          Ever felt it hard to keep track of all those amazing tasks out there
          in the mulearn discord server, or ever felt it overwhelming to do
          tasks one by one, or ever felt it hard to find tasks across numerous
          Interest Groups!
        </p>

        <p class="">
          mulearn Companion app simply is an amazing todo list app you must have
          while exploring the world of mulearn. With this you could easily find
          all those tasks in the server, just by searching for it as well as
          filter them by Interest Groups as well. Almost all the tasks are upto
          date with the discord server.
        </p>

        <p class="">
          This page here explains you how to use this app effectively,
          effortlessly and meaningfully!
        </p>

        <p class="">
          Initially this website is designed in such a way that you could use it
          like a todo app, just for managing your day-to-day mulearn tasks. Here
          you could find all tasks from mulearn discord server, schedule them so
          that you could complete them one by one, Mark tasks as completed so
          that you could keep track of all those completed tasks effectively.
          Also once you mark a task as completed, it's karma points is added to
          your profile and you could view it in the dashboard.
          <strong class="">NOTE</strong> â€£ The karma points here may vary from
          the original karma points you have in your mulearn dashboard, as here
          it is calculated based on the tasks you have marked as completed.
