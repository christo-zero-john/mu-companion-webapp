# mu companion

A new month, a new project. This time I'm doing a project for mulearners (on my own accord of course). Take a guess on what this project could be!! Well, I named it "MU COMPANION", coz it's gonna be your best companion with mulearn. So start guessing. Till next time... ðŸ˜‰

1. Welcome to the server
   Ever wondered how it would be like, when learning is gamified! That's exactly what students of mulearn is always experiencing. In mulearn learning is gamified, thus calling it 'mulearning'. mulearning is similar to Task Based learning(TBL) where students learns about things by doing different kinds of tasks related to topics or trades.

First of all we welcome you to this amazing and interesting community where students learns together from each other. This is a peer learning community, which means, we learns with and from our peers.

First of all this server belongs to the campus chapter of mulearn at Mar Augusthinose college ramapuram. Then again, what is this campus chapter!! mulearn is a big community spanning all across kerala (and still expanding to the national level). Institutions can create campus chapter of mulearn in their campuses, which means students of those campuses can join mulearn and get access to everything in mulearn. By the way, mulearn is a non-profit community, which means everything is completely FREE.

This channel #getting-started will walk you through some QWESTS and help you get an understanding about mulearn, different channels here and their features. Even though the number of quests are quite large, they are so small individually. You can complete these quests in a couple of minutes.

Before that let me mark some points, you may skip these if you are already familiar with mulearn.
