# [mu companion](https://christo-zero-john.github.io/mu-companion-webapp/)

A new month, a new project. This time I'm doing a project for the mulearn community (on my own accord of course). Take a guess on what this project could be !! Well, I named it "MU COMPANION", coz it's gonna be your best companion app with mulearn. So start guessing. Till next time ðŸ˜‰
